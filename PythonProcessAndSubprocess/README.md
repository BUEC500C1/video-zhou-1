Python process and subprocess     
https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html      

<strong> The subprocess module </strong>       
allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.       

1. The run() function     
was added in Python 3.5; if you need to retain compatibility with older versions, see the Older high-level API section.     
subprocess.run(args, *, stdin=None, input=None, stdout=None, stderr=None, capture_output=False, shell=False, cwd=None, timeout=None, check=False, encoding=None, errors=None, text=None, env=None, universal_newlines=None)
