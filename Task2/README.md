Task 2    

Step 1:    
Develop a queue system that can exercise your requirements with stub functions.    
Step 2:    
Develop the twitter functionality with an API    
Step 3:   
Integrate them    

There are 2 folders in my program: img for collecting all images of tweets' contents, output for collecting 2 version vedios (normal one and better one with better quality).    
There are 4 python files: 1st for writing text on image, 2nd for converting images to video, 3rd for collecting tweets'contents from twitter user and last one for own-build queue for handling API calls.
