# What did I do?       
<strong>Task 0 - part 1:</strong>         
Run and test the code provided in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3044580/multiprocessing-vs-threading-python and compare processes and threads        
ThreadsVSProcesses.py       

<strong>Task 1: </strong>      
Play with FFmpeg to test for coverting image to video.      
encodeVideoFiles.py and file for encoding video commands.    

<strong>Task 2: </strong>      
Design a module that can queue and process videos and notify the caller when the videos are ready    
Implement the module    
Include tracking interface to show how many processes are going on and success of each     

# Answers to the hw questions    
For re-encoding video files:   
1. Estimate the processing power need to execute such operations on computer      
Each of them costs around ~200% processing power on CPU.   
2. Estimate the maximum number of such operations that can run on system      
For my laptop, I have 4 cores, 8 logical processors in my CPU. So in order to lose no quality or speed, the maximum number of such operation should be 4 on the system.
