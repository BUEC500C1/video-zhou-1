# Answers to the hw questions    
For re-encoding video files:   
1. Estimate the processing power need to execute such operations on computer      
Each of them costs around ~200% processing power on CPU.   
2. Estimate the maximum number of such operations that can run on system      
For my laptop, I have 4 cores, 8 logical processors in my CPU. So in order to lose no quality or speed, the maximum number of such operation should be 4 on the system.   

For Task 2 questions:    
1. How many API calls you can handle simultaneously and why?    


2. For example, run different API calls at the same time?      


3. Split the processing of an API into multiple threads?
